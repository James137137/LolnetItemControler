Building CommandSigns
--------------------------------------
All libraries required to build CommandSigns are included in the /lib folder. Just
add them to your build path and you're good to go. Note that for releases be sure
you don't export the /lib folder into the jar.

Alternatively, you can use the ant build-file, build.xml. While this file is mainly
for use by the automated build server, running it locally will export CommandSigns.jar
to the /bin directory.
